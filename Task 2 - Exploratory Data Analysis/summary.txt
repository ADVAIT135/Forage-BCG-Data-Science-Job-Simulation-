The BCG project team thinks that building a churn model to understand whether price sensitivity is the largest driver of churn has potential.
The client has sent over some data and the AD wants you to perform some exploratory data analysis.

The data that was sent over includes:

Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage etc
Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data etc
Churn indicator: whether each customer has churned or not

Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, specific parameters, and variable distributions. 

Verify the hypothesis of price sensitivity being to some extent correlated with churn. It is up to you to define price sensitivity and calculate it. 

Prepare a half-page summary or slide of key findings and add some suggestions for data augmentation â€“ which other sources of data should the client provide you with and which open source datasets might be useful?
